# Logo Setup Instructions

## Required Action

To display the NutSphere logo in the header, you need to save the logo image file:

1. **Save the logo image** you have as `nutsphere-logo.png` in the `NutSphere/public/` folder

2. **File location should be:**
   ```
   NutSphere/public/nutsphere-logo.png
   ```

3. **Image specifications:**
   - Format: PNG (recommended for transparency)
   - Recommended size: 400-600px width, maintaining aspect ratio
   - The logo will be displayed at 200px width on desktop and scaled appropriately

## What's Already Done

✅ The navigation component has been updated to use the logo image
✅ Image component is properly imported
✅ Alt text is set for accessibility
✅ Priority loading is enabled for better performance

## After Saving the Logo

Once you save the logo file to the public folder, the logo will automatically appear in the header navigation across all pages of your NutSphere website.

The logo will replace the text-based "NutSphere" branding with your professional business logo.
