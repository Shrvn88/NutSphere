This is how real companies ship.



Task: Implement authentication in a Next.js app using Supabase with two signup/login options on the same screen:

Option 1: Create account using Email + Password with email verification required
Option 2: Continue with Google (OAuth) with no email verification or password

Requirements:

Use Supabase Auth

Create a Create Account / Login page that shows:

A “Continue with Google” button

A divider with OR

Email input

Password input

“Create Account” button

For email + password signup:

Call supabase.auth.signUp

Send verification email automatically

Do not allow login or checkout until email_confirmed_at is not null

For Google login:

Use supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: "google" })

Skip email verification

Auto-create user on first login

After successful login:

Redirect user to /

Store user session using Supabase auth helpers

Show proper error messages for:

Invalid credentials

Email not verified

OAuth cancellation

Use App Router (Next.js 13+)

Keep all auth logic secure and client-side only for Supabase auth calls

Environment variables:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=

Additional:

Use clean UI

Disable submit button while loading

Handle both new users and returning users

Ensure no duplicate users are created

Goal: A production-ready authentication flow where new users can either create an account with email/password (with verification) or instantly sign in using Google.
